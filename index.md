Consul is an accommodation mesh solution providing a full featured control plane with accommodation revelation, configuration, and segmentation functionality. Each of these features can be used individually as needed, or they can be used together to build a full accommodation mesh. Consul requires a data plane and fortifies both a proxy and native integration model. Consul ships with a simple built-in proxy so that everything works out of the box, but additionally fortifies 3rd party proxy integrations such as Envoy.

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, share, and run applications with containers. The use of containers to deploy applications is called containerization. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

- Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
- Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel, making them much more efficient in terms of system resources than virtual machines.
- Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
- Loosely coupled: Containers are highly self sufficient and encapsulated, allowing you to replace or upgrade one without disrupting others.
- Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas across a datacenter.
- Secure: Containers apply aggressive constraints and isolations to processes without any configuration required on the part of the user.
